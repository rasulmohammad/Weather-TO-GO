Description: Weather-TO-GO is an application designed to give users information about the weather conditions in various times and the current air quality. As the world’s environment continues to deteriorate, this application helps users prepare for the modern unpredictable climate while also raising awareness of climate change.

We plan to make a profit off of this application by making our timeline service (which displays the weather at different points in time based on the user’s input) be available for free for a limited number of uses daily.
